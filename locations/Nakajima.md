Nakajima is home to the Constellar Congress of SSC
Nakajima is made of 8 rotating rings, 4 greater, 4 lesser, contained within a cube rotated 45 degrees so that the elevators from Izanagi and Izanami enter at it's corners.
At its center is another cube of the same orientation. It is seemingly made entirely of one way glass.
